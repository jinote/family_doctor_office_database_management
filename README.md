### Project Proposal
# Family Doctor Office Database Management

Doctor’s Offices are typically very traditional and old fashioned. The logistics are often maintained by physical files and require a secretary for appointment booking. This is mainly caused by the fact that (due to lengthy academical programs) the average age of doctors is significantly higher than other professions. The average age of actively licensed physicians is now 51, according to the 2016 United States Census. 
This sector is amongst the last to join the digitalization era.


The purpose of a family doctor’s office is to address general illness. 
Patients would need to book an appointment by calling the secretary to schedule it. 
If patients are calling for a first time, a new patient file would need to be created. 
A patient file typically contains information such as first name, last name, address, email, date of birth, insurance number, current preferred pharmacy, appointments (past and future), medical test results and previous doctor’s notes.
Doctors’ appointments are about 15 minutes long and there are multiple doctors and multiple doctors’ offices available.


The entities would contain: 
- Staff (Doctors and Secretary)
- Patients
- Appointments
- Offices
- Service_Rendered
